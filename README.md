# PL Conference Registration Tracker

Conference registration fees are not always available after the fact.

If one wishes to cost attendance to a conference for grant purposes then it would be good to have access to conference registration data past.

This little side project attempts to keep track of registration fees for various SIGPLAN and PL related conferences.

At the moment the data is stored in CommonMark files.
If a suitable schema can be developed then yaml versions and scripts to process the data could be built.
